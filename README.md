# Load Calculation Using Ultrasonic

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a system to calculate the remaining space in a truck after loading using an ultrasonic sensor and determining the truck’s real-time location using a GPS module.
It integrates an Arduino Uno microcontroller, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and a NEO-6M GPS module to enhance logistics and transportation efficiency.

## Features

- Calculates remaining load space inside the truck using ultrasonic measurements.
- Tracks the truck’s real-time location using GPS.
- Provides accurate load and location information for logistics and transportation planning.
- Cost-effective and scalable system built with commonly available sensors and Arduino.

## System Components

1. Arduino UNO – microcontroller for processing sensor data.
2. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor – measures distance to calculate available space.
3. NEO-6M GPS Module – provides real-time location coordinates.
